  - High contrast mode management
  - Screen reader detection
  - Centralized announcement system

- **Skip Navigation** (`components/skip-navigation.tsx`)

  - Skip to main content
  - Skip to navigation
  - Keyboard accessible
  - Screen reader friendly

- **Testing Framework**
  - Comprehensive test suite (`tests/accessibility.test.tsx`)
  - axe-core integration for automated testing
  - Screen reader simulation
  - Keyboard navigation testing
  - Testing script (`scripts/test-accessibility.js`)

- Comprehensive keyboard navigation
- Detailed error descriptions
- Context-sensitive help

### Testing Results

#### Automated Testing ✅

- axe-core accessibility tests pass
- Jest test suite covers all components
- Keyboard navigation tests pass
- Color contrast validation

#### Manual Testing Checklist ✅

- Screen reader compatibility verified
- Keyboard-only navigation tested
- High contrast mode functional

- Arabic text rendering properly

### Usage Instructions

#### For Developers

```bash
# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:accessibility

# Run specific accessibility tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=accessibility.test.tsx

# Check accessibility in development
npm run dev
# Then use browser accessibility tools
```

#### For Users

1. **High Contrast Mode**: Click the contrast toggle in the header
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape
3. **Screen Readers**: All content is properly announced
